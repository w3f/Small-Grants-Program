Polkadot Grant Proposal: Research Methodology Development - Milestone 1

1. Project Overview

   Project Name: Amplifying Polkadot Staking via Staking Rewards
   Team Name: Staking Rewards
   Payment Address: TBD
   Level: Research (Level 2)

2. Project Description

   2.1. Abstract

        Staking Rewards proposes a comprehensive research initiative to enhance Polkadot’s staking ecosystem by developing a robust and unbiased methodology to rank validators and improve staking accessibility. This proposal also includes deploying intuitive staking tools through Stake App and executing a marketing campaign targeting over 250,000 crypto-focused users. The initiative aims to simplify staking, boost participation, and increase the visibility of Polkadot’s staking features and liquid staking solutions.

   2.2. Background

        Polkadot's staking ecosystem underpins its security, scalability, and governance. Selecting validators for the Decentralized Nodes Pool (DN Pool) requires balancing performance, decentralization, and fairness, yet current methods may lack transparency or fail to capture critical metrics. This project will establish a data-driven ranking methodology, supported by advanced tools and outreach, to empower both individual stakers and the network as a whole.

   2.3. Deliverables

        1. Research-Based Validator Ranking Methodology:
            A framework for ranking validators based on critical metrics like performance, decentralization, security, and staking rewards.
            a. Validator Selection: A ranked list of the Top 16 Decentralized Nodes (DNs), sourced from the Polkadot Decentralized Nodes Program, optimized for inclusion in the Default Nomination Pool.
        2. Stake App Deployment: Tools for seamless staking, risk-optimized validator nomination, and liquid staking integrations.
        3. Marketing Amplification: Targeted initiatives to promote Polkadot staking among a crypto-savvy audience.

   2.4. Stake App Validator Ranking

        As part of the Stake App, Staking Rewards will:

        ● Set up a Nomination Pool as the default staking option, delegating funds to the Top 16 Decentralized Nodes (DNs) selected from Polkadot's Decentralized Nodes Program. This ensures high-performance, reliable, and decentralized validator selection.          
        ● Support direct nomination of individual validators or liquid staking tokens (LSTs) for advanced users.
        
    The Top 16 DNs and the validator ranking used for both the Nomination Pool and direct nomination options will be determined during Research Milestone 1, using the metrics and scoring model developed during this phase.

            ○ List of metrics, categorized into:
                □ Performance and Reliability: Uptime, block production efficiency, latency, 
                  slash history.
                □ Staking and Rewards: Commission rate, APY, minimum stake requirement.
                □ Reputation and Trust: Identity verification, slash-free period, reputation.
                □ Decentralization and Inclusion: Geographical distribution, operator diversity.
                □ Technical Setup: Hardware specifications, client version.
                □ Engagement and Transparency: Governance participation, validator communication.
                □ Financial and Risk: Stake distribution, oversaturation risk, fee stability.
            ○ Analysis of on-chain and off-chain data sources.
