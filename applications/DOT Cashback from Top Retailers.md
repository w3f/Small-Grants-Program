## Project Overview

### Overview

**Name**  
DOT Cashback from Top Brands and Retailers for Polkadot Wallets and Ecosystem

**Brief Description**  
Buy with fiat - get DOT cashback for online purchases - bringing DOT cashback to everyday shopping for Polkadot wallet users.

We’ve integrated with all major affiliate networks. Based on those integrations, we are now able to send wallet users to 16,000+ retailers, and we are growing rapidly.  
How it works: A user purchases any product they wish to, pays as they usually would (credit card or any payment method), and we know how much DOT cashback they deserve and when they are entitled to receive that DOT cashback (assuming they don't return the purchased goods).

We’ll run an omnibus wallet on  Gate.io and accumulate, for each user, the DOT cashback that they receive from the different merchants. The user chooses when to claim their accumulated cashback tokens and move them on-chain.

We’ll manage the price volatility hedging for the DOT tokens as needed and assume all the associated risks.

We’re planning to collaborate with a Polkadot wallet(s) to add this cashback offering to their users as an integral part of their wallet functionality.

**Polkadot Ecosystem Benefits from DOT cashback**
- Attract new investors by offering DOT cashback on fiat purchases
- “Wake-up” dormant users (see more details below)
- Boost brand equity via partnerships with top-tier Web2 brands
- Drive buying pressure for DOT  
- New revenue stream for wallets (earn from every purchase - rev-share)

**Team Motivation**
Bring is all about bridging and connecting Web2 and Web3 ecosystems. 
We do so by integrating **a proven cashback model** into Polkadot’s framework, benefiting wallets, users, 
and the ecosystem as a whole.

- [Yoroi wallet implementation (Chrome web store)](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/yoroi-nightly/poonlenmfdfbjfeeballhiibknlknepo)

The project will not provide:  
1.Signature by the user for claiming his rewards
2. A way to connect to the user's wallet and get the address
3. All Github repos will be publicly available except from our Backend API repository
  

### Ecosystem Fit

 The project is expected to -

-   Contribute to the trust and positioning of the Polkadot brand by associating it with top tier, widely recognized, Web2 brands such as: Nike, Walmart, Samsung, Expedia, Adidas, Decathlon, Uber Eats, Tesco, Doordash, Instacart, Doordash, JBL, Samsonite, Hertz, LG, Dell, Lenovo, GAP, Dyson, Nespresso, AliExpress, Banana Republic and many more...
-   Increase the market demand for DOT and increase transactions on Polkadot - the more purchases, the more DOT cashback - the more DOT we buy in the backend using retailer’s cashback funds and users can seamlessly convert their cashback from all fiat purchases into DOT
-   Contribute to the innovative and positive image of the Polkadot ecosystem - a new way of DOT offering
- Offer real and tangible value to Polkado investors

The project is also expected to -
-   increase the attractiveness of the Polkadot wallets enabling them to acquire more users, thus increasing the Polkadot community
-   “Wake-up” dormant of users as their wallet popups offering them to earn DOT cashback when they visit on-line stores that we work with, thus increasing the activity level of the Polkadot community
    
Those effects will be measured and reported as:
-   Number of users that received DOT cashback via this service
-   Amount of DOT paid as cashback to users
-   Income to wallet from DOT cashback distribution
Business model: 100% paid by the retailer: 60% (user cashback), 20% to the wallet, 20% to Bring. 

**Target audience**  
Any Polkadot wallet or other user facing dapps who wish to implement DOT cashback offerings to their user base.  
  
**Need the project meet:** 
Major challenges wallets are straggling with:
1. Attract new users
2. Keeping users engaged and staying top-of-mind 
3. Generate income to sustain and grow their business, w/o compromising the user’s experience.

**How did you identify these needs?**
Since we are live, our business internal data shows that typically, at list 90% of chrome extension wallet are inactive.

**Are there any other projects similar to yours in the Polkadot ecosystem?**  
Yes. Raise, which enables purchases using DOT and DOT cash back.  

**How is your project different?**  
KEY DIFFERENCES with our integration:
* pay with FIAT- get DOT: enabling new investors into the ecosystem effortlessly - anyone can become a DOT investor instantly by starting to accumulate cashback rewards
* 1000 retailers VS 10,000 retailers
* Minor change of user behavior  - the user doesn’t need to own any other currency and can pay for his shopping just as he normally would
* Much wider range of users - applying to all users, not only DOT holders
* Chrome extension: the cashback experience and offering is embedded within the user’s day-to-day browsing routine and connected to the wallet, so no matter the user’s personal shopping preferences and behavior - we have full coverage on both experiences (mobile and desktop)

**Are there any projects similar to yours in related ecosystems?**  
Yes, Loli enables Bitcoin cashback
StormX - offers its own token as cashback

## Future Plans

As part of creating a **broad framework for DOT rewards** in general (the cashback integration is the first one), we're working on 'Task to Earn' offerings. DApps can offer DOT rewards on activities, incentivising current and new investors to Earn more DOT. The DOT rewards could be implemented in various verticals as Move to Earn (health & lifestyle), Games, Rewarded Social activities, Data Sharing and more.

 - We’ve recently successfully integrated with Yoroi wallet (1 million+ installs)
 - We’ve successfully delivered the first version of this system and launched it on the Casper blockchain which are now adding the browser-extension element as well.  We’ve also integrated with Aurora wallet, the demo is fully functional and there’s a waiting list of users who wish to use it. 
 - We’ve completed a SAFE investment round and have the funds needed to successfully execute this
 - We’ve successfully integrated with Commision Junction, Impact - the two leading affiliate networks. We’ve also integrated with CJ, Rakuten and ShareASale networks. Together, they are able to record the full data of completed purchases in hundreds of stores

Promotion: 
 1. Social presence- collaborate with brands and wallets
 2. Retail Media marketing campaigns - a powerful tool through our good relations with the retailers where users are offered the opportunity to effortlessly earn DOT as cashback from their store purchases. Demographically relevant users (with no affiliation to any blockchain’s wallets) browse a participating store.
 3. Ongoing B2B marketing - in direct contact with all ecosystem players

Long term:
We strongly believe this will be a strong company as we see from market and we plan to build this as a long lasting one.
